# go-addrbook

A vCard viewer in Golang

Similar to [abook](https://abook.sourceforge.io/) but modernized.

## Project Goals

I want a command-line contact book solution that doesn't suck.

## Notes

vCard is a very wonky format. A lot of services implement custom extensions to it.A lot of services are not cleanly operable. The primary services seem to be apple and google contacts
